# Hi, I'm Nolan
I'm a senior at the University of Wisconsin double majoring in Computer Science and Data Science, graduating in December 2025. I’m passionate about using programming and analytics to solve real-world problems, especially in sports. My main interests are in baseball, basketball, and football, and I love the idea that data and statistics can change and improve on-field performance.

My experience spans software development, data analysis, and sports analytics, with projects such as Milwaukee Brewers hitting analysis, a March Madness game predictor, and building applications with React and AI. I’m eager to apply my skills in data analytics, sports analytics, or software engineering roles.
